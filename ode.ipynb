    "# Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will work with a few numerical methods to try to solve and characterize ODEs. Since we do not want to solve ODEs explicitly, we first need an algorithm that can tackle this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most simple method is **Euler's method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler's method \n",
    "For this method, we start by remembering the definition of the derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(t_0) = \\lim_{dt\\to 0} \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, approximately (without the limit), the derivative of a function at a point t0 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(t_0) \\approx \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a first order ODE is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df(t)}{dt} = f'(t) = g(f(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, actually, in an ODE we know that the derivative of a function is equal to some other (complex) function of that function $g(f(t))$. Combining the two equations, we get for a specific point $t_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(f(t_0)) = \\frac{f(t_0+dt)-f(t_0)}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And, solving for $f(t_0+dt)$, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t_0+dt) = g(f(t_0))*dt + f(t_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an iterative algorithm that allows us to move the solution to the equation a little step $dt$ forward, given that we can evaluate $g(f(t_0))$ and $f(t_0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know $g(f(t_0))$, but we do NOT know $f(t_0)$ in general. Therefore, in order to solve this, we need to start at a certain point, which is determined by the initial conditions (also sometimes called boundary conditions). This is necessary for solving ANY ODE!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for a certain point $t_0$, we need to know the value of the function at that point\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t_0)=x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential function\n",

    "Let's do a simple example first. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to integrate the standard equation that gives us the exponential function.\n",

    "## Epidemics\n",
    "Let's study a three-way coupled ODE. For this, we take a look at a simple model of epidemics proposed first in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick (Proc. R. Soc. A, 115, 772 (1927)). In order to model the dynamics of populations, we assume that we have three sub-populations S,I,R:\n",
    "\n",
    "* S(t): the number of people, who are susceptible to the epidemic (the not-yet infected)\n",
    "* I(t): the number of infected people\n",
    "* R(t): the number of people, who are removed from the total population - either because they have become immune or because they die\n",
    "\n",
    "For this SIR-model, we need additional parameters now to describe what happens when one population comes into contact with another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the predator/prey model, we assume that if an infected person from I meets a susceptible person from S, I will infect S. The rate at which they meet is proportional to $S*I$. Let's call this contact probability $a/N$, where $N$ is the total number of people in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to say what happens to the people who become infected. Let's assume that there is a certain time period, during which they can pass on the disease, after which they either become immune or (sadly) die. This process is governed by another time constant $b$ and takes away people from $I$ and adds to $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to set up the dynamics. As usual, we of course model the change in time in these populations:\n",

    "## More Chaos\n",
    "Alright, now that we've encountered chaotic behavior in a rather \"simple\" system, let's check one of the more famous systems that is associated with this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, Edward Lorenz was investigating models of weather processes. These were (and are) often modeled as highly coupled, dynamic systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to scare people, the very, very simplified equations that were used as the start are derived from thinking about convection, that is, the distribution of temperature in a volume. This was already studied by Rayleigh in the early 1900s, assuming a layer of fluid, in which the top is held at a constant temperature difference from the bottom. Assuming, that motion in the fluid can only occur parallel to the x-z-plane, one can then write the following two partial derivative equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\nabla^2\\psi=-\\frac{\\partial(\\psi,{\\nabla}^2\\psi)}{\\partial(x,z)}+\\nu{\\nabla}^4\\psi+g\\alpha\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\theta=-\\frac{\\partial(\\psi,\\theta)}{\\partial(x,z)}+\\frac{\\Delta T}{H}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}+\\kappa{\\nabla}^2\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\psi$ is a stream function for two-dimensional motion, $\\theta$ is the departure of temperature from the temperature in the state of no convection (the steady state), $g$ is the gravitational constant, $\\alpha$ the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\\nu$ the kinematic viscosity, and $\\kappa$ the thermal conductivity of the liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study these rather intricate equations, Lorenz first simplified these to a set of three equations, by assuming that it is possible to write the solutions $\\psi,\\theta$ as oscillations in x-z:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\psi \\approx X(t)\\sin(x)\\sin(z)$\n",
    "* $\\theta \\approx Y(t)\\cos(x)\\sin(z)-Z(t)sin(z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the now-famous Lorenz equations, relating three convection states $X(t),Y(t),Z(t)$ with three parameters $s,r,b$ to each other. The equations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{dX}{dt}=s*(Y-X)$\n",
    "* $\\frac{dY}{dt}=r*X - Y - X*Z$\n",
    "* $\\frac{dZ}{dt}=X*Y - b*Z$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, $X$ describes the intensity of the convection, $Y$ describes the temperature difference between rising and falling currents, and $Z$ describes the distortion of the vertical temperature profile from linear (i.e., the steady-state). $s=\\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}$ is the Prandtl number, $r$ is related to the Rayleigh number that chacterizes turbulent flow, and $b=2.667$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of equations is only accessible numerically, and in addition one should not forget is only a very crude approximation of the original partial derivative equation!\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, Lorenz proceeded to test solutions to this on a computer. One day, after the computer had printed out a set of solutions, Lorenz wanted to continue at a previous time-point. Not wanting to re-run the whole simulation (which had taken days to compute!), he entered the rough numbers from the print-out and re-started the calculation at that time. When he came back, the solution to the ODEs had diverged drastically, even though the initial values were very close together. When investigating the properties of this system in more detail, he found out that arbitrarily-close initial solutions would end up at arbitrarily-far points later in phase space - the Butterfly effect!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will implement this system and show the evolution of the three system parameters over time."

    "# Partial Differential Equations\n",
    "We already had seen above that more complex phenomena require functions of many variables, i.e., the convection functions are dependent on space AND time. Hence, the equations will describe how changes in space or time are related to each other, resulting in partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most simple equations is the heat equation, first studied by Jean Baptiste Fourier. In its most basic form, the equation describes how heat (i.e., temperature) as a function of space and time evolves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}U(x,t) = k*\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}U(x,t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the time derivative of temperature is equal to its double space derivative (up to a constant $k$, which specifies the heat conductivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier showed that possible solutions to this equation (under certain circumstances) are periodic functions - and with this established Fourier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will not do this, but rather do the brute force, numerical approach  to solving this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already can assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial U(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{U(x,t+dt)-U(x,t)}{dt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to work with the second derivative next:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2 U(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\\approx \\frac{U'(x,t)-U'(x-dx,t)}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial U(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{U(x+dx,t)-U(x,t)}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial U(x-dx,t)}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{U(x,t)-U(x-dx,t)}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "together:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2 U(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\\approx \\frac{U(x+dx,t)-U(x,t)-U(x,t)+U(x-dx,t)}{dx^2} = \\frac{U(x+dx,t)-2*U(x,t)+U(x-dx,t)}{dx^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the heat equation, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{U(x,t+dt)-U(x,t)}{dt}=k*\\frac{U(x+dx,t)-2*U(x,t)+U(x-dx,t)}{dx^2}$\n",

    "If we want to integrate explicitly across time, then if we know the values at time $t$, we can find out the value at time $t+dt$:\n",

    "\n",
    "with $c=k*\\frac{dt}{dx^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we finally have a good iterative method that allows us to solve the equation, given a set of starting values. Unfortunately, these equations usually require two sets of additional conditions in order to be solved:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a set of initial conditions, for example, the temperature function $U(x,t=0)$\n",
    "* a set of boundary conditions, for example, the temperature should be a certain value at $U(x=0,t)$ and $U(x=end,t)$\n",

The initial temperature at $t=0$ for the metal is given as: $U(x,t=0) = \\sin(x)$ and the boundary conditions are such that the temperature should be $U(x=0,t)=10$ and $U(x=1,t)=15$ for all times - in other words, we are supplying constant heat to both ends of the metal."

    "Let's try to solve this first, before going on. Let's try to find a homogeneous solution $x_h(t)$ and let's make things specific, so we say $a=1, b=3, c=1$. \n",

    "\n",
